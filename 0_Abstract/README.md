## Abstract

* Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicle’s windscreen.
* The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing wiping system which is free from stopping in the middle of the screeen.
* The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper.
* Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled. 
* The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driver’s concentration during the driving.
* We HAve Used STM32F407VG Microcontroller which is ased on the ARM microprocessor.
